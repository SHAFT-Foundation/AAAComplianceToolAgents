WCAG 2.1 AAA Compliance Tool
"The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." - Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web

Why We Built This
In a world where digital experiences are fundamental to daily life, true inclusion means ensuring everyone can access and use digital content, regardless of ability. The AAA Accessibility Compliance Tool was created with a simple yet powerful mission: to break down digital barriers and make the web truly accessible for all.

People with disabilities face unnecessary obstacles online every day - from blind users unable to understand images without proper descriptions, to deaf users missing critical information in uncaptioned videos, to users with cognitive disabilities struggling with overly complex text. These barriers aren't just inconveniences; they represent real exclusion from essential services, information, and opportunities.

By building this tool, we aim to empower developers, content creators, and organizations to create truly inclusive digital experiences that meet the highest accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AAA). We believe that accessibility isn't just about complianceâ€”it's about human dignity, equal opportunity, and the fundamental right to access information and services in our increasingly digital world.

Together, we can build a more accessible web, one piece of content at a time.
